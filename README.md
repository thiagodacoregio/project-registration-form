The "Registration Form" project on GitHub is a responsive user registration interface created using HTML, CSS, and modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid. This form allows users to enter essential registration information through clean, well-organized input fields. CSS Flexbox and Grid are used to build a visually appealing and adaptable layout that looks great across different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. This project focuses on accessible and maintainable code, providing a strong foundation for integration into larger web applications or as a standalone component.
